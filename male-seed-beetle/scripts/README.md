# Data set on male seed beetles

This data set was first copied from
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4932381) in november 2024. The data
set is looking at the metabolic costs of mating in male seed beetles. It
is licensed in the public domain and can be used for any purpose. If you
have ended up here in search of the actual data set you should go to the
original source.

The data set is in the form of a csv file and contains 19 columns. It is
interesting to us as a first test case as it only contains string based,
and numerical data, which makes it a good test case for the Seedcase
software.
